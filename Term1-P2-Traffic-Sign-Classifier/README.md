## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project, we use what we've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.
